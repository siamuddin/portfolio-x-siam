    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am Siamuddin, a full stack developer from Bangladesh with a deep passion for 
      building meaningful digital products. My journey into technology started with 
      curiosity and quickly evolved into a disciplined pursuit of excellence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside my technical career, I am pursuing a BBA in Business Marketing. This 
      unique combination allows me to understand not only how software is built, but 
      why it should be built. I think in terms of users, markets, scalability, and 
      long-term value.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe great software sits at the intersection of clean engineering, elegant 
      design, and real-world business impact. I aim to create solutions that feel 
      premium, intuitive, and powerful.
